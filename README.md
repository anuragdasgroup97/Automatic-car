Introduction

Welcome to the Automatic Self-Driving Car project! This repository contains the code and documentation for an AI/ML-based self-driving car system that uses computer vision to navigate and make driving decisions. The project aims to provide a foundation for developing autonomous vehicles capable of safely navigating urban and highway environments.

Features
* AI/ML Algorithms: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for real-time decision making.
* Computer Vision: Employs computer vision techniques for lane detection, object recognition, and obstacle avoidance.
* Path Planning: Implements algorithms for efficient path planning and navigation.
* Simulation Environment: Includes a simulation environment for testing and validation.

Simulator details

   I used a car simulator form Udacity and developed our data set using it. Following is the repository link to the simulator I used:
